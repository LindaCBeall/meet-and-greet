# Contributing

## Setting up
We're excited you're thinking about contributing to this project! Before getting started, please review the goals for this presentation, which you can find in the [README](README.md). Next, do the following:

1. Fork the project to your personal account and get a local copy on your machine.
2. Change into the project folder.
3. Run `npm install` from the console.
4. Run `npm start`.

Now you should be able to view the slides at http://localhost:8000/. You can read more about the forking workflow [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#forking-workflow).

## Claiming an Issue

Before you start working on something, let everyone know by claiming an issue. You can either comment on it, or assign it to yourself. If an issue doesn't exist, create one (even it's more of an enhancement rather than an issue).
