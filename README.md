# Welcome!

This presentation has three main goals:
  1. Provide an opportunity for people to get to know their chapter leaders as well as other members.
  2. Introduce some web development basics so that they have a context / big picture idea of what is going on as they dive into more specialized topics.
  3. Give advice on how to get started.
We expect that before coming, many would feel aprehensive about coming to a workshop and hope that after attending the meet and greet, they will feel comfortable coming to future events.
